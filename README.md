# PROJECT TITLE

### __ABSTRACT__
In 1979 the NCAA men's basketball tournament (affectionately known as March Madness) began seeding teams with ranks 1 through 10 into four regional categories. Prior to this time, no ranking of teams was utilized in the tournament. In this paper we present a metric to measure the efficacy of team seedings by the selection committee as compared to tournament results. Utilizing this metric, we compute the efficacy of seeding for both men’s and women’s teams from 64 team tournaments. We then theorize and correlate potential influencing factors. 

### __Project Purpose__    
The purpose of this project was to develop an efficacy rating for tournament seeding and answer the following questions:
* How accurate are team seedings?
* Has seeding efficacy increased or decreased over time?
* What influential factors exist?
* Does seeding efficacy vary across tournaments?

### __Tools used__     
* SAS 9.4  
* Python

### __Results__
